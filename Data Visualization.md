# Data Visualization

## Week 1

### 1.1 Overview of Visualization

#### Mathematical Visualization

- Data results from mathematics
- Missing data can be readily generated by the computer

#### Scientific Visualization

- Data measured or via lengthy, expensive simulations
- Interactive visualization can be used to steer simulations toward more productive directions
- Missing data must be handled
- Coordinate data
  - Spatial coordinates
  - Temperature, pressure, etc.
  - time can be a spatial dimension

#### Information Visualization

- More abstract, non-coordinate data
- Relies more heavily on processing abstract data into a more concrete form that can be more effectively perceived by an observer

#### Modes of Visualization 

##### Interactive Visualization

It is used for discovery, which is intended for a single investigator or collaborators. It rerenders based on input and it is prototype quality,

##### Presentation Visualization

It is used for communication, which is intended for large groups or mass audiences. It does not support user input and it is highly polished.
