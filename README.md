# SummerPlan

This is the 2022 Summer Plan for Eric and Elio. The plan includes the learning of Algorithm and Leetcode.

## Content

For the leetcode, we will follow the order of 150 questions from [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/). Mainly, we will focus on the questions on the website [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com/).

For the introduction of the Algorithm, we will learn using the book, *Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition*.

## Schedule



We are expecting **10** hours each week to focus on the leetcode. Given 5 weekdays, we have 2 hours a day to solve the coding problem and take notes.

#### Current Progress

| Topic           | Progress | Completion Date |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Array & Hashing | (9/9)    | 5/25            |
| Two Pointers    | (5/5)    | 6/7             |

For the introduction of the Algorithm, we will meet twice a week, Tuesday and Thursday, to discuss the question in the book. Before each meeting, we need to finish the reading of the book. The meeting will last 3 hours.
